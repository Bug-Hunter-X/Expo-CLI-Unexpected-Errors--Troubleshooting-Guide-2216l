The most effective solution is to ensure your Expo CLI and related packages are up-to-date. First, update the CLI itself: 
```bash
npm install -g expo-cli
```
Or if using yarn:
```bash
yarn global add expo-cli
```
Next, within your project, update your dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```
Or with yarn:
```bash
yarn install
```
If the problem persists, carefully examine the full error message.  It often provides clues about the source of the issue (e.g., missing dependencies, version conflicts, or issues with native modules).  Search online for the specific error message to find relevant solutions.  If you're using custom native modules, ensure they're correctly configured and compatible with your Expo version.  Cleaning and rebuilding your project can sometimes also resolve temporary issues.
